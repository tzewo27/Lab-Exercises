  Question 6 – Building a Simple Layout with Floats
  ==============================

  Scenario:
    An old-school news site uses a float-based layout for its article sidebar.

  Task:
    Create a two-column layout in news.html:
      - Float a .sidebar <div> to the left.
      - Float a .main-content <div> to the right.
      - Use the clear property on the footer so it sits below both columns.
      - Fix the "collapsed container" problem so the parent wraps both floats.

  Concepts to Use:
    • float: left, float: right
    • clear: both
    • Fixing collapsed container (e.g., overflow or clearfix)

      <h2>Sidebar</h2>
      <p>Links, categories, and other related articles appear here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="main-content">
      <h1>Main Article Title</h1>
      <p>
        This is the main article area. The layout uses classic CSS floats:
        the sidebar is floated left, and this main content is floated right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Floats were widely used before Flexbox and Grid. We also need to clear
        the footer so it appears below both columns.
