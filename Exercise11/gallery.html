  Question 11 – Making a Responsive Gallery with CSS Grid
  ==============================

  Scenario:
    A photographer’s portfolio site needs a responsive gallery that
    automatically adjusts the number of columns based on screen size.

  Task:
    In gallery.html:
      - Create a <div> with the class .gallery containing multiple <img> elements.

    In styles.css:
      - Use CSS Grid with grid-template-columns, repeat(), and minmax()
        to create a fully responsive gallery that works on all devices.

  Concepts to Use:
    • grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))
    • gap
    • Responsive units
    • object-fit: cover for images
