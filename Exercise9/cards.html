  Question 9 – Building a Responsive Card Layout with Flexbox
  ==============================

  Scenario:
    A product page needs a row of feature cards that wrap onto new lines
    on smaller screens.

  Task:
    In cards.html:
      - Create a <div> with the class .cards containing several .card items.
    In styles.css:
      - Use Flexbox so the cards:
          • Arrange in a row.
          • Wrap onto new lines when there isn't enough space.
          • Have equal height.
      - On mobile, make the cards stack vertically using a media query.

  Concepts to Use:
    • display: flex, flex-wrap
    • flex property on items
    • Media Queries (@media)
    • flex-direction: column
