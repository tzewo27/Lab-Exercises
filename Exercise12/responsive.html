  Question 12 – Implementing a Mobile-First Responsive Design
  ==============================

  Scenario:
    Your client insists their site looks perfect on mobile phones first,
    then adapts to tablets and desktops.

  Task:
    In responsive.html and styles.css:
      - Style a simple page for mobile first:
          • single column layout
          • smaller fonts
      - Then use min-width media queries to:
          • change the layout to two columns for tablets
          • change to three columns for desktops
          • increase font sizes on larger screens.

  Concepts to Use:
    • Mobile-first approach
    • Media Queries with min-width
    • Responsive units (%, rem, vw)
    • Progressive enhancement
